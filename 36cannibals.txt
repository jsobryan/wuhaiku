Ain't nuttin' wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V. now No life to live, doc says two more years So after the laughter, I guess comes the tears Early hours, open road, family of five - on their way home Having enjoyed a day in the sun, their encounter with gore has just begun A homicidal fool not knowing left from right, now has the family in his sight Trying to perceive if he's blind or insane, he steers his car into the other lane Both of them collide, expressions horrified Head on at full speed, the vultures will soon feed The father of three was impaled on the wheel, as his skull became a part of the dash His eyeballs ejected his sight uneffected, he saw his own organs collapse His seatbelt was useless for holding him back, it simply cut him in two Legs were crushed, out leaked pus as his spinal cord took off and flew The mother took flight through the glass, and ended up impaled on a sign Her intestines stretched from the car down the road for a quarter of a mile Fourth child on the way, won't live another day Fetus on the road, with mangled little bones Little children fly, not a chance to wonder why Smashed against the ceiling, all their skin burning and peeling Shards of glass explode, chest and skull now implode Corpses they've become, and graves will have to be dug Underneath the wheels, burning rubber on your face Bleeding from your eyes, the slaughtered victims lies Knowing what he's done, he just backs up one more time Laughing at the mess, a pile of meat on the street One child left slowly dying now, arteries gushing blood Now it's time to feed on flesh, the gore has just begun Early hours, open road, family of five - on their way home Having enjoyed a day in the sun, their encounter with gore has just begun A homicidal fool not knowing left from right, now has the family in his sight Trying to perceive if he's blind or insane, he steers his car into the other lane The look of death in my eye Surely no-one will survive Just a pile of mush Left to dry in the sun I see my fresh kill Left in the road Remains of your bodies Mangled and torn One child left slowly dying now, arteries gushing blood Now it's time to feed on flesh, the gore has just begun Wheeled in on a cart, lying dormant not dead Hospital of immortality, butcher their patients bloody red Taken to a dark room, fear of impending doom The doctor straps you down, with an evil grin

the air Bones sticking out, ripped from sockets, blood spurting everywhere Victim lying dead, neck but no head, smearing remains on your own face Violently cutting, seriously hacking, sounds of death

from your mouth As you chew on the piss filled kidney's Suck the vomit through intestines, leaving nothing but bones Human converted to beast, the perfect killing machine Psychotic structure of brain tissue, murder his only memory Dependant on death, crushing your head, I'm addicted to blood Chew the decay The weakened man must die, tearing out his insides Smashing all the bones, hear his tormenting groans Prepare to witness a place of gore Of legal dissection and blood on the floor Carved up corpses, in the corner Sliced up by a psychotic coroner Slice, dice, chop them haphazardly

chop, hack Toss them into a sack Tags on bare feet, means a real treat, to the butcher of human meat Slice the throat from ear to ear, gallons of blood do appear Veins exposed, torn from bodies, the most interesting of hobbies To get paid for such a task is more than any man could ask Prepare to witness a place of gore Of legal disection and blood on the floor Carved up corpses, in the corner

brain Evil doctor death drove him insane Enter the crypts of hell, to impregnate the dead Fresh burial sight, my hunger grows tonight Undying lust for cadaverous molestation Sights of death building my sensations Ferocious need for decomposing bodies Sex with the dead now I must breed Within the stiff corpse planting my seed The taste of formaldehyde, smell of the rot Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch Raging fires of hell, burning through my soul My love for a dead fuck, I cannot control The child soon will rise, all evil will survive Birth through death The newborn needs a feast, its mother is the meal Chomping on her flesh, his teeth tearing her skin I love to fuck the dead, demons in my head Tearing at my brain Bleeding sores beginning to stench While you lick the festering stump Green infection discharging pus Devour the putrid afterbirth Sex with the dead now I must breed Within the stiff corpse planting my seed The taste of formaldehyde, smell of the rot Suck out the goo, feast on her crotch A quivering pile of useless flesh, locked in a padded cell Hidden from the prying eyes of curiosity Experimental surgery made him what he is today His head is rotting but his body lives on as a worthless vegetable Unknown to mankind, the incredible power of his mind Hideous heredity, genetic imbalance, resorting to cannibalism A feast begins as the patient's skull is cracked open like a walnut Brains devoured in a frenzied slaughter, thrist for gore nothing more Bile is dripping, pus from wounds, as the coroner drinks it down The sights before your eyes you can't describe A trip through this living hell will rot away your skull Genital lacerating, anal asyphyxiation Blockade of bowel passage, defåcation, hemmorage Cadaverous mutilation, metamorphial radiation Devourance of arteries, decapitated extremeties Cranial excavation, cerebral liquidation Brain turned to soup, ears are dripping goop Slimy, cozing, dripping pus, torn out fingernails starting to fuse Shredded cartilage victim lies, eye sockets, but no eyes Miles of intestines strewn all about, facial features strickened with gout Hanging bodies dripping with blood, the blackened fluid sinks in the mud Undead feast, as they tear upon your weak flesh Terror builds, at the thought of being dead Prophecy of the wisemen of old Now comes true, as the corpses break the soil Ancient spell breaks the sleep of the dead The dead awake, what the populace is fearing Panic strikes as the nations run in fear Oceans boil with blood of human victims Suicide, the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead Grave yards coming alive with zombies, hungry for living flesh Psychotic, transmutated corpses, upsuring the population Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions, devouring us Tables turn as a victim I've become now State of death only waiting to return Vital signs that show I'm dead This can't happen, I'm rising from my own grave Hunger grows not nutritional but instinctual Flesh becomes my only crave of this live Unthinking state, a state of metamorphisis Seeking food to keep me dead Degenerate, a product of man's frustration for his terror Insatiable hunger for mankind, building with each kill Seeking human victims to meet my fill Cannibal I've become, what's happened to my brain Feast on the corpse, suck out his brain As its fluids drip down the drain Chew on the bones, drink from its bladder The vile stench only makes me madder In through the mouth, out the forehead Brains fall out, skin turns red Violent surge, a spear through the skull Felt the urge, now my heart's full I crave gore, I'll eat your guts I love gore, blood drives me nuts I drink blood, I don't like water Intestines my cud, I feast in the slaughter Twist its neck, make it crack Suicide, the only way to avoid being eaten by the undead Grave yards coming alive with zombies, hungry for living flesh Psychotic, transmutated corpses, upsuring the population Sickening disaster of epidemic proportions, devouring us Blood I want to drink, I want to suck Brains I want to eat, the rest I'll chuck Bones into a spear, I'll carve and kill Hunger for the quest, I'll never fill I crave gore, I'll eat your guts Walking down the street, the smell of death in the air What a rotting stench My imagination runs wild at what this could be Open up the can to discover a dead body Or what was left of one, pieces in a bag Blood is everywhere what a retched sight Cut up really small by a razor sharp knife Lying in the garbage no one else knows What I have found, what should I do Take it to the police or make it into stew This was an evil committed by the insane Looking down laughing, I am the same The sight of death drives me nuts, I must kill, to control my brain Swept away by my lust to cause pain, mutilation is my only want The evil inside me gives me the strength to kill at will My life is the means to cause death in the most sinister ways I see it in your eyes the fear that keeps me alive I'll take it away, your life will end today I'll leave you to rot, what a sick odor Scream all you want, but you can't stop this horror Tasting your life as I drink your blood Ripping out your insides, chewing on your spleen Dead or living flesh is what I crave I'll kill someone or eat from a grave Lying there cold after a torturous death Your life ended fast you took your last breath Dead in a grave, your final place The maggots infest your disfigured face Pus through your veins takes the place of blood Decay sets in, bones begin to crack Thrown six feet down left to rot Brains oozing black down the side of your broken neck Skull full of maggots They enter your tomb - maggots - beginning to feast - maggots Crawling on you - maggots - now they eat you - maggots Rotting maggots - maggots - infesting your corpse - maggots Parasites of the dead - maggots - now dwell in your head Lying there cold after a torturous death Your life ended fast you took your last breath Dead in a grave, your final place The maggots infest your disfigured face Pus through your veins takes the place of blood Decay sets in, bones begin to crack Thrown six feet down left to rot Brains oozing black down the side of your broken neck To kill, is why I live My God, gives eternal life Slice you, I watch your blood flow Rotten brains, I feed 'till I'm full Pressure building, the body starts to swell The souls of my victims brings me great power Feasting on flesh by the hour Lungs explode as I cave in your chest Probing through your organs - searching for meat Chewing the heart of my kill builds by evil will Bodies emptied of blood to fill my sacrificial chalice I stalk my prey at night, I need to kill tonight To strengthen my evil soul, those that I kill worship me below I am your worst reality, pain and torture of humanity Violent ways of insanity, there is no end to this cruelty In my grasp, I'll kill you fast, I'll send your soul to hell Butchery of Human beings is the only life I know My armies of zombies will inherit the earth, and answer to my spells Mutilated the human race in search for immortals I drag the carcass home, it feels stiff and cold Incantation of the devil to rob it of its soul Consume the lifeless cadaver, I drink your blackened blood Its death flows through my body, indulge in its pain Crucifixion in the cemetery, awakes the dead from their sleep Rising from their graves, to devour the weakened mortals Under my control, I own their tortured souls Butchery, my meat hooks sharpened to penetrate Emasculate, gouging crotches I will eat Hung upside down, holes punctured through half chewed gristle, Debauchery with dead bodies, turning green Upheaval of human entrails Deterioration of grated genitals Dangling from the hooks Obscene feelings deep inside me Dislocating, separating a blood-drenched body Begin the anal grouting Awaiting insertion To rip out intestine Bodily destruction Vulgar molestation Treachery, never ending soul ripping Lifeless bodies rot, petrified Clogging veins, pressure building Scabbing clotted sores dehydrate Condemned to life of obscurity Dismal dimensions of my being I explore my thoughts through murder Devoting my life to mutilation Screams of blood saturate Grubs feed on dilapidated stumps Darkness overshadowing...

those I infect, become my loyal servants To ride me of my own rot Whittling meat from the bones of the dead Pulverizing pelvic regions with a sledge The mutilated bodies I leave rotting After I have fucked them with my knife Becoming a product of my own nightmares A bleeding sac of infection, years deceased I hide my slobbering skin, covered by a victims flap I love to watch the blood ooze down the bodies stump like sap, A vulgar way of life, my hideous side now revealed Remembering the future is the key to unlock my past Leaking membrane, consuming bodies Carving out the cunts, blood my lubrication Spewing pus on rotted skin I celebrate my cruelty, Boils begin to form, Dripping on my tongue Swallowing throbbing glands, The juice leaks from my lips, My only thirst is pus Eruption of cysts Incurable disfigured bodies, I rape the dying Horrific sights now manifest, penetrating inner organs The ruptured organs leak the fluid that I seek To break the incantation of my damnation Split wide open, Bloated organs burst Nerves uprooted, Reopening healed wounds On my body Sucking on the sores Ingesting my own fluids Self-parasitic puss indulgement Grotesque, crippled, carved up carcass Evil controlling my mind, The fear of dying expired of life, To vomit the soul I am dead within my self The end a beginning to a new life in hell I am your path to ever-lasting pain Mass extinction of the human population Son of the devil the evil incarnation Maniacal mass murderer mutilating mortals, The child born unto evil, Trapped within the statue of flesh Vipers travel through bodily orifices, Blessed by the devil Under inverted crosses, Religious ways, Lies controlling minds I walk among mortal beings, but I have died Excavating graves I search for decay Packs of flesh driven zombies ready to feast I suffer forever living only to dismember Open season on humans, Laughing I watch them die, They bleed so easily Their blood flows through my body, I need to taste the flesh Exposing pulsing arteries Removing vital organs Not stopping till you've died Pus from your eyes carnal ways indulge in the gore Slaughtered you lie in a pile of warm guts Constricted corpuscles coagulating Blood my drug a slave to its taste, Reincarnated to human form, Creating a race of immortal beings, Rot away Dead bodies, set a flame Searing flesh, broken necks You can't kill what's already dead De-evolution, hunting for life Cannibalism, immortality Rip and slash, a society of mass murder Bleeding slow I take away your life, And leave you lying cold, Decapitated body Searching for its head Anticipate apocalypse, Rising dead dismembering Hacking limbs Bleeding, Cracking ribs Torture us Blessed by the devil, Under inverted crosses Religious ways, Lies controlling minds I walk among mortal beings, but I have died Excavating graves Desolate Empty hollow corpse, Desecrate Forced to eat your flesh Extracting purity Violate Twisted bodies rot away Birth is always painful Decaying in the womb Trapped within this body A bleeding human tomb Gutted bitch lies dead Emptied of the child Chewing on the cords Its life line to this world Afterbirth is flowing The stench is overwhelming My body, growing stronger My pain turns to torture Severing its bloodline A butchered infant carcass Meat from the unborn The freshest kills Chopped up children Bathing in blood Contorted and festering I rot in disgust Re-generation of my body Mother ripped apart Smashing in her face My knife cutting holes Fucking her remains Esophagus carved out Crushing cartilage Bile oozing from Punctures in your liver Ripping meat within Chewing on intestine Bladder spurting urine Sight of defecation Now grow infection The child ripped to shreds Drinking its excretions Zombification Ejaculation over mutilation On the mother's body hacked into pieces The sludges from my cock give her life once again Sewing the remains of the child deep within her Reborn through evil My torture known throughout Hell Heed to his calling The demons await my next kill Carnage is my fetish Body cavities scraped of guts Brains seeping from cracks As my axe continues to hack Torsos hang from their own intestines Raped of all bodily extensions, Stumps wreathing in sludge like infection Suffering through a Rancid amputation A pulsating artery accompanied by some veins, Slit with no restraint Sacs of pus develop My muscles tighten as I feel the rush I look at your body starting to gush I slice through the limb, a human dissection Portions of half-eaten flesh in my mouth Starting to chew your now bleeding stump I will swallow your pus Your own rectal slime I'll force you to drink Vessels explode as needles injected Uncontrollable, my brain tormented Slit from head to toe, die through the torture Disease engulfs you, internal rot Fresh cut wounds, beginning to clot Ripping through flesh is what I do best Tear off an arm, amputated neck Eyes removed, cranium smashed Decomposing remains, severed in half Dying slowly never to rest, Nerves are quivering as I rip Removal of life on the blade of my knife Inserted in your spine, smashing through bone Feel my hell, I feed on fright Rape the limbless cadaver Rotting alive Tearing my way through the meat Driven to kill, My brain twitching for guts Devoted to evil Severed arteries gush Hungry for the blood Life is to decay Victims meet my blade, carving out organs A world of pain and terror Visions of the future Premonition of the evil, Forthcoming eve of darkness The chosen one will come Eyes torn out, bodies cut in half Twisted corpses hang from broken necks Demented madman, unholy rampage Impaled cranium beginning to drain Sodomize the carcass, chew the anal rot Sewn within the body the dark becomes my light Live inside the shell, feed upon infection At one with the dead I rip my way through easy prey, Disfigured bodies decompose Chewed limbs drip with pus, Intestinal strangulation Humans left ripped apart Lap up the dripping goo Wretched chunks of bleeding flesh Internally you rot away My need to kill induced by hate, Betrayal of trusted ones My mark left on this earth, Victims of my slaughter Souls of my dead, murdered by my hand Blood on my face, innards decay Snapping necks chewing flesh Insatiable thirst for blood Slicing throats viciously Uncontrollable insanity Tear out the beating heart Engulf the quivering spleen, Chew the meat Death is my life Life is to decay victims Meet my blade carving out organs, A world of pain and terror, Visions of the future Premonition of the evil Forthcoming, eve of darkness Eyes torn out bodies cut in half Twisted corpses hang from broken necks, Demented madman, unholy rampage Impaled cranium beginning to drain. There's something inside me It's, it's coming out I feel like killing you Let loose of the anger, held back too long My blood runs cold Through my anatomy, dwells another being Rooted in my cortex, a servant to its bidding Brutality now becomes my appetite Violence is now a way of life The sledge's my tool to torture As it pounds down on your forehead Eyes bulging from their sockets With every swing of my mallet I smash your fucking head in, until brains seep in through the cracks, blood does leak distorted beauty, catastrophe Steaming slop, splattered all over me Lifeless body, slouching dead Lecherous abcess, where you once had a head Avoiding the prophecy of my new found lust You will never live again, soon your life will end I'll see you die at my feet, eternally I smash your face facial bones collapse as I crack your skull in half Crushing, cranial, contents Draining the snot, I rip out the eyes Squeezing them in my hands nerves are incised Peeling the flesh off the bottom of my weapon Involuntarily pulpifying facial regions Suffer, and then you die Torture, pulverized At one with my sixth sense, I feel free To kill as I please, no one can stop me Created to kill, the carnage continues Violently reshaping human facial tissue Brutality becomes my appetite Violence is now a way of life The sledge's my tool to torture As it pounds down on your forehead I don't know I just took that knife And I cut her from her neck Down to anus And I cut out the vagina And I ate it A relapse of my body Sends my mind into multiple seizures Psychologically a new human being One that has never been Cursed by the shamen his voodoo spell has my soul My limbs go numb I can't control my own thought Are his now his evil consuming me ever telling me begin the clit carving Slowly turning me, into a flesh eating zombie Knowing this spell can only be broken by the vaginal skins of young women I proceed to find the meat their bleeding cunts will set me free I can't control my own thought I can't control my own thoughts Warmth seeping from this Body Rotted After I sucked the blood from her ass I feel more alive more alive than I've ever been Even though now I'm dead within My mouth drools As I slice your perinium My body smeared With the guts I've extracted through her hole, came swollen organs cunnilingus with the mutilated My spirit returned from the dead Released by the priest but I felt more real when I was dead The curse is broken I have a dependence on vaginal skin It's become my sexual addiction I must slit, the twitching clit Rotted cavity hold the juice Between the legs, I love to carve My cock is dripping with her blood Swollen with liquid Ready to burst A load of my lymph Will quench this dead body's thirst One month in the grave twisted and half decayed She turned a putrid yellow I pissed in her maggot filled asshole Fucking the rotting My semen is bleeding The smell of decay Seeps from her genital cavity The smell was unbearable As I unburied her I cum blood from my erection I feel it run down her throat, swallow Eyes glassy and vacant body dug up to play with Skin greasy and naked tounguing her rotted anus I need a live woman to fill with my fluid A delicate girl, to mutilate, fuck and kill her body exceptional she thought I was normal but I wanted more I came blood inside of her chocking on the clot gagging on the snot gushing blood, from her mouth bloody gel leaking out Body buried in a shallow grave Unmarked for none to find The sickness I have left behind Undetected go my crimes The greatest thrill of my life To slit my own cock with a knife Violent, climax Serging serum on my skin Back from the dead I am resurrected to spew, putrefaction Melting thoughts of disintegration Hitting deep her insistance to mutilate her newborn infants After giving birth her mind wasn't the same Slowly slipping away, a state of mental decay Family now complete Father watches on As mother dismembers her newborn son Dissecting the specimen, split I will explore, the body wide open Uncover carnage within, split wide open Virgin, untouched skin Releasing her rage That dwells inside tainted blood rushes through veins her body chemically changed Love was erased, on the edge of a butcher's knife The kitchen becomes a makeshift slaughterhouse every nine months she butchers one more child Reminders of the deceased, scattered through the home Bones and skulls of sons and daughters Genitals ferment In jars inside the cupboards for father to dissect No one will discover the murder they commit Children used like laboratory rats Sickening vulgar experiments She sees what others can't Probing the guts of her fetus Advocation of the pain Mutilating, draining veins Witness the horror offering to themselves Continuing murdering their own kind Never deny this fantasy life, they enjoy Addiction to this heightened state Post-birth psychosis disjointing her own children form the life they'll never live A massacre within her soul Struggling for control I was once a man before I transformed into this molester, freshly deceased children You have born, torn by my rape The dead are not safe, the lifeless child corpse I will violate Pleasure from the dead, complete satisfaction I open the coffin Sick thoughts run through my head as I stare At the dead, over and over, I can't escape I begin the dead sex, licking her young, rotted orifice I cum in her cold cunt, shivering with ecstasy for nine days straight I do the same She becomes by dead, decayed child sex slave her neck I hack, cutting through the back I use her mouth to eject Here I cum, blood gushes from bleeding black blood her head disconnected As I came, viciously I cut, through her jugular vein She's already dead, I masturbate with her severed head My lubrication, her decomposition Spending my life molesting dead children Intercourse with infants Curing heads on top of spikes boiling skulls Skin sliding off of bones Voices The voices call Voices The voices are calling me Buried dead I've spiritually infected Call to me from beyond their graves Bleed I now bleed pus I bleed, the blood of the dead I bleed on her livid skin Thrusting myself within Beginning to chop through her hairless crotch Beyond what we know as death It haunts me everyday I hear the voice of every child That lies next to me decayed A fresh corpse, to fill with my infection Tortured before death, no orifice left unfilled Violated after death Virgin hole I infest Anal pore spewing cess The sacred juice I injest Your dead child I defile Tearing at my neck my sharpened teeth pierce the meat My warm bloodied prey sustains my life for one more day The oldest of souls, left behind after life Before death I was nothing but human Indulgence in the blood, intoxicated from its drug It warms my cold soul Tapping the gushing sap, trickling down my throat Rejuvenation of my body No blood left to scab Now it flows through my veins Heaven I have found Fear in my grip Transcend beyond mortal The sweet blood I will swallow Draining the inner spirit Feasting on the power Knowing only pleasure Human blood I devour Ghastly beauty look into my eyes to reproduce with the living every century Impregnation of the virgin I drink the blood of the unborn Returning to my grave dragging my blood drained prey My body burns from the light Sleeping until night In my clutch, you greet me with open arms soon I will rip them off And drink the blood from the stumps Life and death are too clear but mankind is blind to see the twisted path of their own mortality Scripts of the dead Netherworld knowledge Rotten fragrance lingers Unleash the odor I have risen Vampire Zombie Sucking on Arteries body numbs One of my sons died for your sins Resurrect him so I can drink his blood again Alive alone now that they've gone dead but unburied I've seen it unfold, terrible scenes of agony Eyes in the darkness Echoing their madness The sights that have passed before them Watching as though it has never happened Now I only listen to what is not spoken Murder, hatred Anger, Savage Killings I have caused more than can be counted orgies of sadism And sexual perversion Virgin Tied to my mattress Legs spread wide Ruptured bowel, yanked From her insides Devirginized with my knife Internally bleeding Vagina, secreting her blood-wet pussy I am eating on her guts I am feeding Mutilated with a machete I fucked her dead body The first and last Your life's only romance My knife's jammed in your ass As you die you orgasm Pass on to the dead Nerve trembling convulsions No longer looking human I never see them, but I know they're there Locked in my subconcious Obscene memories I thought I'd forgotten Haunting unrealities Tear at me Hold her arms Her mouth taped shut Screams unheard Out pour her guts Layers of flesh peeling away Languish in your own decay descriptions of my killings bone chilling Terror, tear, her Virgin cunt Virgins are my victims Their tight interiors I explore Sharpened utensils of torture Now inserted inside of her Sex organs extracted for eating On her liver I am gnawing Forbidden lust for guts Ripped from her cunt Tears of blood cry down her thigh I ram my fist inside her hole From her crotch piss now flows Rectum filled with shit I fucked her emptied body Until she became stiff Suffering my only need now is to hang the rope does swing, hanging from the darkened ceiling Strangling, dangling from my twisted spine I knew I would enjoy death more than life My lids close tight, but the light blinds my eyes My body grows cold - my cock becomes erect Watching over my dead shell, from beyond in my own hell Caught between life and death, even though my body's dead I still feel the touch of flesh Given the choice to die or live dead Purgatory my damnation Climaxing at the resurrection Adipocere spurts from my erection Manifested in my rotted body Unpure spirit, dead among mortals I have risen from self-murder Only to rot and kill to break the necks of young women their cunts my pus will fill Acid burning through her crotch I baptise her face with my rot Then venom foams from her throat On my discharge she will choke Pulsation, my heart begins to beat Heaving, goiters start to secrete caustic odor, steaming gruel wallow in my infected drool Swollen pusing gashes Start to reek Puncture wounds in the back hacked up limbs, bones now crack Skin fillet from your face Breasts gounged out I fuck with your chest Nude and violated I raped the life from her body Lying dead the insects bite her pale skin My marks of torture Left on my daughter Body badly beaten I remember My ropes and chains Bruised her arms and legs I wiped her blood on my face Her tender body I disgraced Slow strangulation Her neck twisted and broken Abdominal lacerations Blood pouring from Abrasions Control of the mind Feelings left behind Dreaming inner hate I create an alternate state of the grave Scared to death Homicidal premonitions Horror fills you As your soul is ripped from you Dreaming my dream of death I cast the spell Intertwine your mind with mine Dreams become reality Enhancing the imagination Murder is my infatuation Killing off generations Families torn to pieces But the one they love Possessed by another My pleasure is to murder Entering your dreams Through my spell they will bleed Night after night Reoccuring killings Sleep Someone wake me From this nightmare I've become my darkest fear Awaken to the sight Of your hacked up family Their spirits are trapped Beyond the cemetary Bodies rotting, but I'm not sleeping Scream you're not dreaming Someone wake me Form this nightmare I've become my darkest fear Came to life In my mind A world of darkness Forever sleeping in this coffin Eternally dreaming... Forever sleeping in this coffin No escape from your fate Destined to be mine Every night I wait to see In the night, watching Stalking your every move I know when you're alone All alone Tied tight to the bed Legs spread open Bruised flesh, lacerations Skin stained with blood I'm the only one you love I feel her heart beating my knife deep inside Her crotch is bleeding She liked the way it felt inside her Fucking her, harder, harder She liked the way it felt inside her Fucking her, harder, harder Stick it in Rip the skin Carve and twist Torn flesh From behind I cut her crotch In her ass I stuck my cock Killing as I cum You thought it was over, it's not over I came back, I brought my axe In the shadows, alone in the dark Young victims I stalk You thought it was over, it's not over I came back From the grave To mutilate Axed in the back Pick through the neck Dead like the rest Molested and left Limbs split in half I ruptured their flesh Puncture wounds To the head Bone fragments clot to the hatchet Knee-deep in the blood of the dead Cranial separation Sex with her severed head Rotten walking dead Hunting living victims
